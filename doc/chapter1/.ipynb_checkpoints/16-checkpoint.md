# Section 1.6

A set of numbers can be written as $\{1,2,3,...\}$. 

The set of real numbers is denoted: $\mathbb{R}$.

The set of natural numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{N}$ and is equal to $\{1,2,3,...,\}$.

The set of whole numbers is the set of natural numbers including the zero element.

The set of integers is denoted $\mathbb{Z}$ and equal to $\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$.

The set of rational numbers is denoted $\mathbb{Q}$ and equal to $\{\frac{p}{q}\,|\,p\in \mathbb{Z},q\in\mathbb{Z}\{0}$.

The set of irrational numbers are real numbers that are not rational numbers.

Given $i=\sqrt{-1}$ we have the set of complex numbers denoted $\mathbb{C}$ and equal to $\{a,b\in\mathbb{R}\,|\,a+ib\}$.

The equation $x^2-1=0$ has two solutions $x=1$ and $x=-1$. However, the equation $x^2+1=0$ has no real solutions. Unless we consider $i=\sqrt{-1}$. Then we say $x^2+1=0$ has two solutions $x=i$ and $x=-i$.

Suppose $n$ is a natural number then $a^n=a\cdot a\cdot a \cdots a$ where $a$ is multiplied $n$ amount of times. Considering this we have the following properties.

:::{prf:property} Laws of Exponents
:label: lawsExponents
$a^m\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, $\left(a^m\right)^n = a^{mn}$, $\frac{a^n}{a^m}=a^{n-m}$, $a^{-n}=\frac{1}{a^n}$, and $\frac{1}{a^n} = a^{-n}$.

Also,

$(ab)^n = a^n\cdot b^n$ and $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$.

Remember $(ab)^n=a^n\cdot b^n$; however, $(a+b)^n\ne a^n +b^n$.
