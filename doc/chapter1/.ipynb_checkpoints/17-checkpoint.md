First, we will look at a simple example involving inequality notations.

::::{prf:example}
:label: linearInequality1
Solve $1-5x>11$.

:::{dropdown} Solution:
We solve the inequality the following way. Notice that when dividing by $-5$ we flip the inequality.
\begin{align*}
    1-5x & > 11\\
    -5x & > 10\\
    x & < -2
\end{align*}

The graph of the solution is: ![graph!](linearInequality1.png)

The solution set is $\{x\,|\,x<-2\}$

The interval notation is $(-\infty,-2)$.
