Let $y_0$ be the amount or number present at time $t=0$. Then, under certain conditions, the amount $y$ at any time $t$ is modeled by 

$$y=y_0e^{kt}$$

where $k$ is some constant.
:::

* If $k>0$, then the model is called exponential growth.
* If $k<0$, then the model is called exponential decay.

## Exponential Growth Model

::::{prf:example}
:label: expGrowthProb1
In the year 1990 the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide was $353$ parts per million and then in the year 2000 the amount was $375$ parts per million. Since the model is exponential find the function.

:::{dropdown} Solution:
We want to find the function $f(x)=y_0e^{kx}$ where $x$ is the number of years after 1990 and $f(x)$ is the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide in units of parts per million.

First, we will use the fact that $f(0)=353$ to find $y_0$.

\begin{align*}
    f(0) & = y_0e^{k(0)}\\
    353 & = y_0e^{0}\\
    y_0 & = 353
\end{align*}

This means the function is $f(x)=353e^{kx}$. The year 2000 means $x=10$. We will then use $f(10)=375$ to solve for $k$.

\begin{align*}
    f(10) & = 353e^{k(10)}\\
    375 & = 353e^{10k}\\
    e^{10k} & = \frac{375}{353}
\end{align*}

After composing both sides by the natural log function we have 

\begin{align*}
    \ln(e^{10k}) & = \ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)\\
    10k\ln(e) & = \ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)\\
    k & = \frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)
\end{align*}

This gives the function:

$$f(x)=353e^{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)x}$$
:::

How much atmospheric carbon dioxide will there be in the year 2020?

:::{dropdown} Solution:
The year 2020, $x=30$. That means we want to evaluate $f(30)$.

$$f(30)=353e^{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)(30)}\approx 423$$

That is, in the year 2020 there will be 423 parts per million atomspheric carbon dioxide.
:::

In what year will the amount double from the amount in 2000?

:::{dropdown} Solution:
In the year 2000 the amount was 375 parts per million. We want to find $x$ such that $f(x)=560$ (double the amount in 2000).

\begin{align*}
    f(x) & = 560\\
    353e^{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)x} & = 560\\
    e^{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)x} & = \frac{560}{353}\\
    \ln\left(e^{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)x}\right) & =\ln\left(\frac{560}{353}\right)\\
    \frac{1}{10}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)x\ln(e) & = \ln\left(\frac{560}{353}\right)\\
    x & = 10\cdot \frac{\ln\left(\frac{560}{353}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{375}{353}\right)}\\
    & \approx 76
\end{align*}

That is, it will take about 76 years for the atomospheric carbon dioxide to double from the year 2000 amount.

## Exponential Decay Model

::::{prf:example}
:label: decayModelProb
Suppose 800 grams of radioactive substance reduces to 400 grams of substance 2.5 years later. Find the exponential model for this situation.

:::{dropdown} Solution:

We are trying to find the function:

$$f(x)=y_0e^{kx}$$

Since, the substance starts with 800 grams we have:

\begin{align*}
    f(0) & = 800\\
    y_0e^{k(0)} & = 800\\
    y_0(1) & = 800
\end{align*}

Which then gives: $y_0=800$.

Next, we want to use the fact that $f(2.5)=400$ to find $k$.

\begin{align*}
    f(2.5) & = 400\\
    800e^{k(2.5)} & = 400\\
    e^{2.5k} & = \frac{400}{800} \text{ or } \frac12
\end{align*}

After composing both sides by the natural log we have

\begin{align*}
    \ln(e^{2.5k}) & \ln(\frac12)\\
    2.5k\ln(e) & = -\ln(2)\\
    2.5k & = -\ln(2)\\
    k & = -\frac{\ln(2)}{2.5}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the equation of the model is:

$$f(x)=800e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{2.5}x}$$
:::
How much of the substance will be present after 4 years?

:::{dropdown} Solution:

Here we want to evaluate $f(4)$. We will then get

$$f(4)=800e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{2.5}(4))}\approx 264$$

That is, there will be 264 grams of the substance.
