:::{prf:definition}
:label: linearEquation
Definition 0.1. The definition of a linear equation can be extended to more than one variable. Any equation of the form

$$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n = b$$

for all real numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ... , $a_n$ (all nonzero) and $b$, is a linear equation, or a first-degree equation, in $n$ unknowns.

:::{prf:theorem}
:label: solutionSystemCases
There are three cases for solutions of linear systems in two variables:

1. Two graphs intersect in a single point. The coordinates of this point give the only solution of the system. Since the system has a solution, it is **consistent**. The equations are not equivalent, so they are **independent**.
2. The graph are parallel lines. There is no solution common to both
equations, so the solution set is $\emptyset$ and the system is **inconsistent**.
Because the equation are not equivalent, they are **independent**.
3. The graphs are the same line - that is, they coincide. Because any solution of one equation of the system is a solution of the other, the solution set is an infinite set of ordered pairs representing the points on the line. This type of system is **consistent** because there is a solution. The equations are equivalent, so they are **dependent**.

## Two-by-Two System of Linear Equations

:label: 22systemExam1
Solve the system

$$
\begin{cases}
4x-3y & =14\\
x-2y & =1
\end{cases}
$$

:::{dropdown} Solution:

First, we will solve for $x$ from the second row equation.

\begin{align*}
    x-2y & = 1\\
    x & = 2y+1
\end{align*}

Next, we will substitute $x$ into the first row equation. Then solve for $y$.

\begin{align*}
    4(2y+1)-3y&=14\\
    8y+4-3y & = 14\\
    5y+4 & = 14\\
    5y & = 10\\
    y & = 2
\end{align*}

Now that we know $y=2$ we will substitute it back into $x=2y+$ to solve for $x$.

\begin{align*}
    x & = 2(2)+1\\
    & = 5
\end{align*}

Therefore, the solution set is $\{(5,2)\}$.

:label: 22systemExam2

Solve
$$
\begin{cases}
2x+3y & =-1\\
3x-2y & =18
\end{cases}
$$

:::{dropdown} Solution:

\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
2x+3y & =-1\\
3x-2y & =18
\end{cases} & \to_{3\times R_{2}}^{2\times R_{1}}\begin{cases}
4x+6y & =-2\\
9x-6y & =54
\end{cases}\\
 & \to_{R_{1}+R_{2}}13x=52\\
 & \to x=4
\end{align*}

Since $x=4$ we will sub it into any of the equations (we'll use the first equation) and then solve for $y$.

\begin{align*}
2(4)+3y & =-1\\
8+3y & =-1\\
3y & =-9\\
y & =-3
\end{align*}

Therefore, the solution to the system is $\{(4,-3)\}$.
